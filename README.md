# Programming1_Deliverable

This is the project that I must complete for my first in compter science technology

*PLEASE CHECK MASTER TO SEE PROGRAM*

You have just started work for the Vanier College Teachers Association (VTCA) and have been
asked to write a program to assist teachers with:
(1) maintaining a list of student grade records for a course,
(2) basic analysis of the grades, and
(3) computing a student’s final numeric grade and final letter grade.
You are told that a student’s grade record includes a student’s name and number, together with
a list of assessment grades for that student. Your program is to display the results in a table form,
showing the names, weights, and grades of all the assessments included in a grade record (such
as homework, assignment, quiz, midterm, final exam, etc.), together with basic statistics (such as
maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, etc.) on each assessment.
